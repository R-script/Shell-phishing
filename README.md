# Shell-phishing
A FLOSS repository for phishing using UNIX for internal pen-testing

The purpose of this is to provide users that share a network with instant feedback of a phishing attempt from the systems admin.

This program runs in multiple parts, with the first being to install the necessary packages to both connect to the machine using netcat and to add the banner function.
